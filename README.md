# Pong

Pong by Atari is one of the first video games ever created, originally published in 1972. This version of Pong can be played in CodeSkulptor by clicking [here](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user41_1B8osfynKZ_0.py).

The program is written in Python and makes use of lists, keyboard input, vectors and motion, collisions and reflections, velocity control, and mutation. It was submitted as a mini-project to Rice University's online course, Fundamentals of Computing Specialization, offered through [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/fundamentalscomputing2).
